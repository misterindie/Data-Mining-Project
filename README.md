# Data-Mining-Project

This project was created for my Fall 2019 Data Mining Class at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.

## The Objective

To determine key features that lead to highly rated products within the brewing industry through the data anlysis 
of over 1,000,000 reviews frome the review aggregator site, BeerAdvocate. The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rdoume/beerreviews)
